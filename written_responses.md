1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

>a. A block is mined and added to the chain by the node (such as a computer maintaining a copy of the blockchain) that discovered it.  

>b. If the node determines it is a valid solution, the node will hash (hashing is generating a value or values from a string of text using a mathematical function) the previous block and add it to the new block and the rest of the block's properties (timestamp, index, list of pending transactions) which are now confirmed.

>c. It then shares the new block with the nodes in its network and they check the new block to make sure that it has an index one higher than the last block, a previous hash that matches the previous block, and a valid solution. 

>d. The new block is added if it passes the test.  Consesus is determined by the longest valid chain.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

> Blockchain users can mine coins by participating in the guessing of the current blocks proof of work which is an arbitrarily difficult problem to solve. If they can guess correctly they then win and as a reward for guessing they are compensated in the form of a coin.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

> Simulations resemble real life processes.  It is interesting for physicists, biologists, economists, mathematicians, philosophers, generative scientists and others to observe the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of very simple rules.  Computer simulations are playing an increasingly important role in sciences such as biology, in testing hypotheses and generating new ones.
